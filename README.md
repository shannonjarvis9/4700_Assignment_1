# 4700 Assignment 1
ELEC4700 Modelling of Integrated Device  
Monte-Carlo Modeling of Electron Transport

In this assignment, the drift current in a silicon semiconductor crystal was modelled using Matlab. 

A simplistic Monte-Carlo model was used to simulate the random motion of electrons within a rectangular silicon structure. The scattering of electrons using an exponential scattering probability and a botteneck boundary was added in parts 2 and 3.
